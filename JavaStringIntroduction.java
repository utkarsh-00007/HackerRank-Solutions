Problem Statement 11: Java Strings Introduction
"A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable." â€” Wikipedia: String (computer science)

This exercise is to test your understanding of Java Strings. A sample String declaration:

String myString = "Hello World!"
The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.

Given two strings of lowercase English letters, A and B, perform the following operations:

1-Sum the lengths of A and B.
2-Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B come before A in the dictionary?).
3-Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
Input Format

The first line contains a string A. The second line contains another string B. The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.

Output Format

There are three lines of output:
For the first line, sum the lengths of A and B.
For the second line, write Yes if A is lexicographically greater than B otherwise print No instead.
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

Sample Input 0

hello
java
Sample Output 0

9
No
Hello Java
Explanation 0

String A is "hello" and B is "java".

A has a length of 5, and B has a length of 4; the sum of their lengths is 9.
When sorted alphabetically/lexicographically, "hello" precedes "java"; therefore, A is not greater than B and the answer is No.

When you capitalize the first letter of both A and B and then print them separated by a space, you get "Hello Java"
